    But still it's farewell
    And maybe we'll come back
    To Earth, who can tell?
    I guess there is no one to blame
    We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
    Will things ever be the same again?
    It's the final countdown
    The final countdown; oh
    We're headin' for Venus (Venus)
    And still we stand tall
    'Cause maybe they've seen us
    And welcome us all, yeah
    With so many light years to go
    And things to be found (to be found)
    I'm sure that we all miss her so
    It's the final countdown
    The final countdown
    The final countdown (final countdown) (Oh) Oh
    The final countdown, oh
    It's the final countdown
    The final countdown
    The final countdown (final countdown) (Oh)
    It's the final countdown
    We're leavin' together
    (The final countdown)
    We'll all miss her so
    It's the final countdown (final countdown) (Oh)
